### Project Title: **Average cost of undergraduate student by state USA**    
<br>

Introduction: Given an opportunity, people want to pursue college education for various reasons. The reason might be getting a high-paying job, developing skills, increase job opportunities just to name a few. There are other mixture of reasons for an individual in going to college. But letâ€™s face the reality, that the expenses (tuition, room & board) often get in the way.


Project Description: This project will look at the data from year 2013-2021 on the average cost of college in the USA by state, type of institution, length of study, and year. It will assist in providing a deeper understanding on the financials of undergraduate education across the US. Specifically it will contribute in answering common questions listed below if one is evaluating going to college.

 - Which 5 states had the lowest & highest average tuition fees in a public out-of-state and private institution for year 2021 and  what is the percentage from the lowest and the highest cost?

 - Is there a significant greater cost between Private and Public Education. 

 - Can one afford to get a 4-year undergraduate degree with a budget of $10000 per year on expenses (tuition & room/board)?

 - On the map, can we see the locations that present where I can assess the states to choose a college?

 - What type of institution would one go to on a tight budget to pursue an undergraduate education? And is is best to start  with a 2 year and then move to a 4 year? 

 - What kind do the higher brackets looks like for the more expensive schools and what part of the states have the most schools? 

 - Evaluation to determine if Covid had an Impact to lessen the standard increase

2. Is there a significant greater cost between Private an Public Education.     
	+ Private does have a great cost indicated however based on the mean it is only about a $4000 variance. Our average for private is $30949 and for public it is $26,949.

3. Can one afford to get a 4-year undergraduate degree with a budget of $10000 per year on expenses (tuition & room/board)? 
	+ Yes, based on the analysis a person does have options for a 4 years degree in some states but they are minimal and private. We can see public schools showing starting about $12K. 

4. On the map, can we see the locations that present where I can assess the states to choose a college? 
	+ Yes the heat map gives us indicators of cost and where you would typically find lower and higher cost for schools. 

5. What type of institution would one go to on a tight budget to pursue an undergraduate education? 
And is it best to start with a 2 year and then move to a 4 year?  
	+ Based on the analysis the 2 years has a lower cost overall and may be the best place to start on a budget and move to a 4 years if funds are increasing and budget can sustain. 

6. What does higher priced school look like and how much more expensive are they and what part of the states have the most schools? 
	+ We can see costs for higher priced schools with pricing range over $100K annually and even greater than $140K.  You can see on the map that school are over but more abundant in the Middle, East and far West States. 

7. Evaluation to determine if Covid had an Impact to lessen the standard increase:  
	+ Based on the data that we have here, we do not see an impact for any decrease in school costs. More data may reveal additional conclusions but as of today, no impact. Only increases from year to year based on trending from 2013-2021.
