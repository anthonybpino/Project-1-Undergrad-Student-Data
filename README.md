-   Average price at all ranked private colleges for school year 2021 – 2022
-   Average price increase during a five year period (is it rising by how much %)
-   Average price at all ranked private colleges for school year 2021 – 2022
    Average price increase during a five year period (If interested to go in out-of-state at ranked public schools:)

-	Looking for type of school (private / public-in-state/ public-out-state) maybe- do all states offer the same?? Not sure

-	What schools offers certain fundings (scholarships, state or federal fundings)
-	Did COVID-19 has an effect on the fees (can we ask if we can the affect covid by looking to see if the average before 2021 was inline with the standard increase from year to year prior to 2019 )
-	CHARTS NEEDED:  
    heat map for cost per state.
